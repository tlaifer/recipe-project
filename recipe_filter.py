    Outline:

    Grab recipe data from search algo and grab filters from client:
    - Sort by using the most ingredients (e.g. vegetables are about to go bad)
      or by using the fewest extras (e.g. I don't want to go to the store)?
    - Technique filtering â€“ add checkbox like "familiar techniques only"?
    - If we want to get fancy: put ALL ingredients in ALL returned recipes into
      local memory cache, and from there, allow user to uncheck things (e.g. one
      of the returned recipes requires lobster and I don't want to pay for that)
    - Any other things?

    After search algo builds basic recipe dictionary by eliminating vetoed things,
    cache the recipe dictionary locally to allow users to sort/filter the results
